# Team Formation

Each project team consists of ideally 4 students and will be formed in Week 2. Students will be able to choose some of the teammates, but the rest of the teammates will be randomly allocated.

The process is divided into 2 steps:

Step 1: Choose some team members

* Form a group of 2 people.

* Register your group on Canvas under People -> Project Team Formation by deadline stated on Canvas.

If you are unable to access, please contact Tzer Bin (dcsnt@nus.edu.sg) via email / MSTeams as soon as possible.

Step 2: Randomly get some team members

* Groups (and anyone without a group) will be randomly combined.

* Teams will be announced by Week 2 Mon 6pm.

Let us know if you have any issue in working with students in your team by the end of Week 2 Tue 6pm.
